# NBA Wage Prediction by Machine Learning

This project aims to predict NBA player wages using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes historical player data and various machine learning algorithms to create models that can accurately predict player wages based on relevant features.

## Project Structure

- `NBA Wage Prediction.R`: This script contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the models.
- `models/`: This directory stores the trained machine learning models.
- `results/`: This directory holds the evaluation results and any visualizations generated during the analysis.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

## Dependencies

To run the script, you need the following dependencies:

- R (version X.X.X)
- library1 (version X.X.X)
- library2 (version X.X.X)
- ...
